## Predict UEFA Champion League quarter final 

In this project I will using Random Forest Classifier to predict the result of quarter final of UEFA Champions League.
My dataset include: 
 - matches: information about history matches from 2016-2022
 - elo rating: elo rating points of each club team (by UEFA). Elo rating is a measure of the relative skill levels of players or teams in a competitive game, originally designed for chess, but it has since been applied to various sports, including football.
 - team stat: statistics features related to teams like attacking point, defending point
